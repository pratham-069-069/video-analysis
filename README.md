Okay, let's break it down really simply, like explaining it to a friend who hasn't done this before.
1. What is this project trying to do? (The Goal)
Imagine you made a YouTube video, maybe about your cat playing with a toy.
YouTube Tells You: "100 people watched your video, and 20 people liked it." Cool, but why? Was it the part where the cat jumped? The part where you talked?
Our Project Does This: We're building special computer tools (our "pipeline") that act like super-smart detectives for your video. These tools will:
Watch the Video: Like a robot, it notes down when things change on screen (e.g., "At 0:15, the cat jumps onto the sofa").
Listen to the Video: It turns your talking into text and even tries to guess if you sounded happy, sad, or neutral at different times (e.g., "At 0:30, you sound excited").
Read the Comments: It looks at what people wrote and tries to see if they sound happy or angry, and if they mentioned specific times (like "1:05 was so funny!").
Connect the Dots: This is the important part! Our tools try to link everything together. They might find out: "Hey, that part at 0:15 where the cat jumped and you sounded excited got a lot of 'likes' right around that time, and people commented 'Cute jump!'"
The main goal is to figure out exactly which parts of a video make people keep watching, hit the like button, or leave comments. It helps creators understand what's really working inside their videos.
